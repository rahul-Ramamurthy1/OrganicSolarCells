# OrganicSolarCells

**Objective**

Finding better materials to optimize energy output of organic solar cells (OPVs)


**Description of Dataset**

The "Small Molecule Donor Materials" dataset (csv) has been created using past research data from the paper "High efficiency small molecule-based donor materials for organic solar cells" by Rashid Ilmi, Ashanul Haque, and M.S. Khan.<br />
The dataset contains the names and chemical formulas of various chemical compounds that were used in an attempt to improve the efficiency of OPVs. 
For each compound, the following are measured: <br />
HOMO (Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital) energy <br />
LUMO (Lowest Unoccpied Molecular Orbital) energy <br />
PCE (Power Conversion Efficiency) <br />
Jsc (Short-circuit density) <br />
Voc (Open-Circuit Voltage) <br />
FF (Fill Factor) <br />
The composition of the solar cell in which each compound was used is also included in the above dataset. <br />


**Use-Cases for the Dataset**

Discovering which compounds result in the highest energy efficiency increase for OPVs using Machine Learning algorithms <br />
Determining which compounds prove detrimental to OPV performance <br />
